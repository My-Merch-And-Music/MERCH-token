🎯 MMAM / $MERCH Weekly Giveaway + Shirt Reward Rules


🔹 Purpose

The MMAM $MERCH giveaway exists to reward real supporters who engage with our mission of building artist-first infrastructure. Not bots or speculators. All rewards support community growth, not personal profit.


🎟 Entry Method

Each week’s giveaway requires an entry payment in $MERCH tokens (or any other officially designated method).
 
The specific amount and wallet address for entry will be posted at the start of each giveaway period (via official MMAM social channels + Zealy).
 
Participants must submit proof of entry (e.g. transaction hash or wallet confirmation) if requested.
 
Only those who enter via the official method are eligible for prize drawings or the bonus shirt raffle.


🎟 Weekly Paid Giveaway Structure
	
Each week, you may enter the giveaway by submitting the required $MERCH tokens (or other designated entry method).
 
Your weekly XP on Zealy determines your entry multiplier:
 
0–49 XP → 1x entries

50–79 XP → 2x entries

80–109 XP → 3x entries

110–139 XP → 4x entries

140 XP → 5x entries (100% engagement)
 
The more you engage, the more chances you have to win.
 
XP resets weekly for giveaway purposes (but stays visible on your Zealy profile).
