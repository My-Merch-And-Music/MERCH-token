🎯 MMAM / $MERCH Weekly Giveaway + Shirt Reward Rules


🔹 Purpose

The MMAM $MERCH giveaway exists to reward real supporters who engage with our mission of building artist-first infrastructure. Not bots or speculators. All rewards support community growth, not personal profit.


🎟 Entry Method
	•	Each week’s giveaway requires an entry payment in $MERCH tokens (or any other officially designated method).
 
	•	The specific amount and wallet address for entry will be posted at the start of each giveaway period (via official MMAM social channels + Zealy).
 
	•	Participants must submit proof of entry (e.g. transaction hash or wallet confirmation) if requested.
 
	•	Only those who enter via the official method are eligible for prize drawings or the bonus shirt raffle.


🎟 Weekly Paid Giveaway Structure
	•	Each week, you may enter the giveaway by submitting the required $MERCH tokens (or other designated entry method).
 
	•	Your weekly XP on Zealy determines your entry multiplier:
 
	•	0–49 XP → 1x entries
	•	50–79 XP → 2x entries
	•	80–109 XP → 3x entries
	•	110–139 XP → 4x entries
	•	140 XP → 5x entries (100% engagement)
 
	•	The more you engage, the more chances you have to win.
