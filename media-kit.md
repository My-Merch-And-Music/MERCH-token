### 📌 Short Description
$MERCH is a Solana-based utility token powering MMAM, a nonprofit platform for independent artists. No VC. No presale. Just real infrastructure and artist-first growth.

### 📌 Long Description
MMAM (My Merch And Music) is a nonprofit platform built to support independent artists through affordable merch, weekly giveaways, and long-term venue and tech infrastructure. Powered by $MERCH — a fixed-supply token on Solana — MMAM reinvests all revenue back into creator growth via Nexus Capital Holdings. No private allocation. No hype. Just real use and future-facing development.
