# $MERCH Liquidity Commitment

At launch, 10% of the $MERCH supply will be paired with SOL and deposited into a Raydium liquidity pool.

To ensure absolute trust and transparency, the corresponding LP tokens will be **permanently burned**, making this liquidity **irrevocable** and fully decentralized.

## Why Burn Instead of Lock?

Burning LP tokens:
- Eliminates all withdrawal risk permanently
- Removes the need for third-party locking services
- Creates an immutable, trustless base layer for $MERCH trading

## Supporting Treasury Model

While only 10% of the supply is added to LP, an ongoing **5% transfer tax** allows MMAM to:
- Support token liquidity dynamically
- Reintroduce supply gradually and responsibly
- Fund infrastructure without destabilizing the price

The combination of **burned LP + treasury emissions + nonprofit reinvestment** makes $MERCH a long-term artist-backed token with no predatory mechanics.
