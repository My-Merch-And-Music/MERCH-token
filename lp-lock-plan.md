🔐 $MERCH Liquidity Lock Plan

At launch, a liquidity pool was created on Raydium pairing $MERCH with SOL. The LP tokens received from this deployment were permanently burned, ensuring the liquidity can never be withdrawn or altered.

🔥 Why Burn Instead of Lock?

Burning LP tokens offers stronger guarantees than third-party lock services:
	•	Irrevocable: LP tokens are destroyed permanently and cannot be recovered
	•	Trustless: No custodian, no unlock date, no rollback
	•	Immutable: Guarantees that initial liquidity will always remain on-chain

This approach protects traders from rug pulls and provides lasting confidence in the integrity of the $MERCH market.
