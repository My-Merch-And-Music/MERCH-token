# $MERCH Tokenomics

## Total Supply: [INSERT YOUR SUPPLY HERE]

The $MERCH token is designed to empower artists and fund the long-term infrastructure of the MMAM platform. There is no presale, no VC allocation, and no private investor dump risk.

## ðŸ“Š Token Allocation

- **10% Liquidity Pool (LP)**  
  Initial LP added at launch and locked.

- **90% Treasury Reserves (Multi-Wallet)**  
  Controlled by MMAM and used exclusively to fund:
  - Venue development
  - Tech infrastructure (MMAM App, ticketing, etc.)
  - Artist support programs
  - Ecosystem expansion

## ðŸ’¸ Transfer Tax

- **5% Tax on Transfers**
  - 5% routed to the treasury
  - No burn, no redistribution
  - Used to gradually offset token supply drained by trading activity

## ðŸ§  Emission Policy

- No more than **2% of total supply** will be released in any 30-day window unless otherwise announced
- All transactions will be publicly viewable via labeled wallets

## ðŸ›¡ Governance

Governance is controlled by MMAM to ensure long-term protection of artist incentives, platform infrastructure, and treasury integrity. A DAO-lite advisory model may be implemented in the future.
