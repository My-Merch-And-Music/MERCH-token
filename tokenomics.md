# $MERCH Tokenomics

## ðŸ§± Total Supply: 1,000,000,000

$MERCH is a fixed-supply token deployed on Solana to support artist empowerment, platform growth, and long-term infrastructure development through MMAM â€” a nonprofit initiative.

There is no presale, no VC access, and no private allocation. The token was launched publicly with liquidity locked at inception.

## ðŸ’¸ Transfer Tax: 5%

All $MERCH transfers carry a 5% transaction fee:

- 100% routed to treasury wallets  
- Used to fund marketing, platform development, artist tools, and token liquidity  
- No burn. No redistribution. No stealth inflation.

## ðŸ›¡ Trust & Governance

MMAM retains governance over treasury and platform development to ensure alignment with its nonprofit mission. All major treasury transactions will be public and traceable, with transparency maintained through labeled wallets and periodic updates.

In future stages, a DAO-lite advisory system may be introduced to offer community feedback on treasury usage, artist support, and platform growth.

**$MERCH is purpose-built to serve creators â€” not speculators. All mechanics exist to fund utility, not hype.**
