# $MERCH Tokenomics

## 🧱 Total Supply: 1,000,000,000

$MERCH is a fixed-supply token deployed on Solana to support artist empowerment, platform growth, and long-term infrastructure development through MMAM — a nonprofit initiative.

There is no presale, no VC access, and no private allocation. The token was launched publicly with liquidity locked at inception.

## 💸 Transfer Tax: 5%

All $MERCH transfers carry a 5% transaction fee:

- **100% routed to treasury wallets**
- Used to fund marketing, platform development, artist tools, and token liquidity
- No burn. No redistribution. No stealth inflation.

## 🛡 Trust & Governance

Governance is intentionally centralized under MMAM to protect the platform’s mission, ensure artist-first incentives, and maintain long-term structural integrity.

> $MERCH is purpose-built to serve creators — not speculators. All mechanics exist to fund utility, not hype.
