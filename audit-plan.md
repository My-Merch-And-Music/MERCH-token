# $MERCH Audit Plan

The $MERCH contract was generated using a trusted token creation platform and deployed to the Solana mainnet.

We plan to pursue a formal audit with a reputable Solana-based auditing firm post-launch. Our focus is on contract integrity, treasury transparency, and safeguarding platform operations for artists and users.

In the interim, we commit to:
- Publishing the verified contract address post-launch
- Providing labeled wallet transparency for treasury accounts
- Using non-custodial, immutable contract features whenever possible

Audit status and reports (once available) will be posted here.
