$MERCH Audit Plan

The $MERCH contract was generated using a trusted token creation platform and deployed to the Solana mainnet.

We plan to pursue a formal audit with a reputable Solana-based auditing firm post-launch. Our focus is on contract integrity, treasury transparency, and safeguarding platform operations for artists and users.

üîç Treasury Oversight & Ownership

All tokens not allocated to public liquidity are held in MMAM-controlled wallets. These tokens are owned by the nonprofit, not by individual developers or team members, and are managed exclusively to support the platform‚Äôs charitable mission.

While on-chain analytics may highlight concentration among treasury wallets, this structure is:

Fully intentional
Legally attributable to MMAM
Mission-aligned and non-speculative
These reserves are used solely to fund platform infrastructure, venue development, artist tools, and ecosystem expansion. No portion of the treasury is allocated for private enrichment, team salaries, or profit-taking.

This distinction will be disclosed in audit documentation and listing applications to ensure transparency without compromising operational security.

üßæ Interim Commitments

Until the formal audit is completed, we commit to:

Publishing the verified contract address post-launch
Ensuring wallet structures maintain operational security
Using immutable and non-custodial contract features where applicable
Audit status and reports (once available) will be posted here.
