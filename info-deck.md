# \$MERCH Token Info Deck

## 🎯 Project Summary

**\$MERCH** is a Solana-based utility token powering MMAM (My Merch And Music), a nonprofit platform built to empower independent artists with real tools, real revenue, and long term infrastructure support.

* **Chain**: Solana
* **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000
* **Utility**: Giveaways, artist merch, ticketing, app access, venue integration
* **Launch**: Targeting late July 2025

## 🚀 Why \$MERCH?

Traditional music platforms exploit creators. \$MERCH flips the script by enabling artist-owned infrastructure, decentralized merch profits, and community-powered distribution all backed by a fixed-supply token.

## 🧱 Token Mechanics

* **Fixed Supply**: 1B tokens, no minting
* **Transfer Fee**: 5% (100% goes to treasury)
* **No Burn / No Redistribution**: Sustainable, utility-focused economics
* **Treasury Ownership**: Held by MMAM nonprofit; usage tied to artist-first objectives

## 💡 Use Cases

* Enter weekly **raffles** with multipliers via Zealy
* Claim **exclusive merch drops** from MMAM artists and custom shirts through MMAM
* (Coming Soon) Buy **event tickets** and access token-gated perks
* Support infrastructure development: venues, artist tools, MMAM app

## 🔐 Trust Model

* LP tokens burned at launch (Raydium)
* No presale, VC allocation, or team wallets
* Treasury controlled by MMAM, directed through Nexus Capital Holdings for venue builds and infrastructure

## 📈 Ecosystem Overview

* **MMAM**: Nonprofit artist platform (merch + discovery)
* **Nexus**: For-profit holdings partner that invests MMAM proceeds into long-term assets to distribute back to MMAM artists and investors
* **Zealy**: XP-based quests + weekly giveaways

## 🌍 Vision

* Artist-owned venues
* National artist merch and ticketing platform
* Nonprofit ecosystem funding creators over speculators
